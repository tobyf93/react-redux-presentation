------------------------
ECMASCRIPT 6
------------------------
- Arrow functions
  - Look familiar to anyone
  - That is the new way of writing an anonymous function
  - Saves typing
  - JavaScript has a keyword called 'this' which can often cause confusion
  - Arrow functions 'this' in a more intuitive way
  - Example one
    - JavaScript way of writing a class.  This is a person class.
    - test in node, why doesn't it work?
    - 'this' will actually refer to the Interval object
- When i first came across ES6 - WTF is this shit?
- Embrace ES6 now, it's going to be standard in JavaScript shortly (get used to it)

------------------------
JQUERY
------------------------
- Polyfills for DOM manipulation across browsers
- DOM traversal
- General utility functions

------------------------
SINGLE PAGE APPS
------------------------
- Gave code a lot more structure
- Separation of concerns: MVC example

------------------------
REACT
------------------------
- They are willing to implement it in Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp
- Google, Angular, reluctant to follow suit

- Airbnb
  - Demo of site
  - Was originally Ruby on Rails (MVC Framework)
  - Multipage structure with React components
  - Eventual transition to SPA
- Atlassian
  - Biggest tech company in Australia
  - Originally in Django (python), MVT (model-view-template)
  - Again, multipage being phased out for React
  - Rebuilding HipChat in React over Angular (MVC) and Ember (Model-view-viewmodel)
  - Have experience in Angular from previous employment, would pick React every time
- Dropbox
- Netflix
  - Biggest video streaming service
  - Wanted to improve readability, complexity of app
  - Had teams develop new UI's in jQuery, Backbone and React and measured performance
  - React won
  - Able to do a total rewrite in a few months
  - Modularity meant better A/B testing
  - Faster to bring people up to speed
  - Using falcor for state management

- jQuery style vs React style
- render() doesn't necessarily mean DOM change
- Virtual DOM
